/* BWB: This is an ugly hack which will probably break serializing
   std::strings for MPI communication (which we thankfully don't
   generally do).  In Boost versions prior to 1.40, there was a bug
   which resulted in compile errors if a BOOST_CLASS_EXPORTed data
   structure contained an std::string.  We do use std::strings for
   classes which are serialized but not sent using MPI (like most
   elements), so that posed a problem.  Checkpointing pays no
   attention to this define, so it doesn't break those */
